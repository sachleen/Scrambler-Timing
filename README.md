Scrambler-Timing
================

Laser timing device for the Scrambler event in Science Olympiad

The photogate system uses two lasers and two sensors. When the scrambler passes through the start sensor, it begins timing. When the scrambler passes through the finish sensor, it sends a signal to the start sensor to stop timing.
